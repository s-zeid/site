So Ludovico Einaudi's new album, *In a Time Lapse*, came out the other day,
and it's absolutely incredible.  I've had ["Newton's Cradle"][newtons-cradle]
going through my head for the past day, and I'm listening to ["Walk"][walk]
right now as I type this.  ["Experience"][experience] is pure awesomeness.
["Underwood"][underwood]?  Too pretty for words.  The whole album is sheer
awesomeness.  Also, ["Two Trees"][two-trees], ["Life"][life], and ["Run"][run].
And the rest of it, of course.  I've been waiting for this album since it
was announced on his Facebook page, and I'm loving it.

There's just *one* problem.

You can only get it on iTunes.

This is a problem for several reasons, the most important (for me) being the
fact that I use Linux, and iTunes doesn't run on Linux.  That means that I
have to open up my Windows XP virtual machine (I'm having problems with my
Windows 7 one, or I'd use it) just to buy the album.  I also do not like
Apple as a company, mainly because of how they run their mobile operations
(locking down iDevices without giving customers an option to open them up,
placing draconian restrictions on app developers, etc.), and so I generally
boycott them.  (I just *had* to break it for this album though, and I resent
that.)

Most importantly, however, **iTunes is *not* the only online music store in
existence, and pretending it is is not good for the free market nor for
consumers.**

(When I took a break from writing this, I saw on my Facebook News Feed that
[it was just released on Spotify][in-a-time-lapse-spotify], but it's missing
the five bonus tracks.  And the digital booklet.)

## This is not just a problem with *In a Time Lapse*{.inline-block}.

It is a problem with much of Ludovico Einaudi's work.

*Nightbook* (the album) is not available on Amazon MP3.

![Amazon MP3 search results for '"Ludovico Einaudi" Nightbook']({% postfile nightbook-amazon.png %})

[But it is on 7digital.][nightbook-7digital]  But, wait!  There are supposed
to be two bonus tracks:  "Solo" (appears as "Piste Sans Tistre [sic] 13") and
"Berlin Song".  Only the first one is there.  (Of course, "Berlin Song" *is*
in [the iTunes release][nightbook-itunes].)

The bonus track on *Divenire*, ["Luce"][luce] (the link is to a cover), an
absolutely gorgeous song, is also [absent from Amazon MP3][divenire-amazonmp3]
and [7digital][divenire-7digital], and, as it turns out, [it's also not on
iTunes][divenire-itunes].

*Islands:  Essential Einaudi"* is a collection of his previous work as of
2011, but it also has some new (or hard-to-find) material on it, such as
"High Heels", "The Earth Prelude", and some songs from his *Doctor Zhivago*
soundtrack (listen to ["Writing Poems"][writing-poems]!).  But if you want
to download it legally, you have to [give money to the devil][islands-itunes].

*Cloudland*, a collaboration Ludovico did with the brothers Robert and Ronald
Lippok under the name Whitetree, is also [only available on 
iTunes][cloudland-itunes].

(Note:  all the iTunes links are here not to encourage you to give Apple money,
but simiply to prove that they're on iTunes.)

But I'm in the United States.  Ludovico is from Italy.  Maybe I'll have better
luck if I go across the pond?
