[AppBackup]({{ site.url }}/projects/appbackup/) 2.0.2 is out and fixes the following
issues:

* Fixed a bug with translations where if something wasn't translated then nothing
  would appear in the UI (expected behavior is that the English text would appear
  instead).
* AppBackup no longer crashes if backuptimes.plist is corrupted or malformed.

Also, the Czech, Japanese, and Korean translations have been updated.Â  The new
version should be on Cydia soon.
