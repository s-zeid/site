I've released version 1.0.13 of AppBackup, which brings the following changes with it:

* Added the ability to ignore and un-ignore apps in the backup list and when using
  the All button.
* Fixed a crash caused by an error in the Dutch translation.  (Tim van Neerbos was
  consulted about the problem string.  This bug only affected users who have their
  language set to Dutch.)
* The unique bundle ID of each app is now displayed under its name in the
  backup/restore prompt.

[Download](http://uploads.srwz.us/AppBackup/latest.php) or wait for it to show up on
BigBoss.
