I have released AppBackup 1.0.14.  This is a **SECURITY UPDATE**.  You should
update **AS SOON AS POSSIBLE** in order to keep your device secure.

**AppBackup still does not work on iOS 4.3.x; however you should still update for
security reasons.** I am in the process of rewriting AppBackup so that it will work
on iOS 4.3.x, and I am very sorry for the long wait.

[Download](http://uploads.srwz.us/AppBackup/latest.php) or wait for it to show up
on BigBoss.
