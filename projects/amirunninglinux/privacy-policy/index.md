This is the privacy policy for Am I Running Linux?, which consists of
[a Web site][amirunninglinux.com] and [an Android app][amirunninglinux.apk].
As they are [free software][free-sw] and thus can be modified by anyone, this
policy ***only*** applies to the official distributions:

**Web site:**

* As hosted at `amirunninglinux.com` and its subdomains, or on the same server

**Android app:**

* As distributed through a source code repository or Web page owned by the user
  `scottywz` on Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub, or hosted on the server that hosts
  `s.zeid.me`
* As distributed through [the official Google Play listing][google-play]

*Note:  "Server" in this context does not include other virtual machines on a
virtual machine host.*

Source code
-----------

**Both amirunninglinux.com and the Android app are [free software][free-sw];
therefore, *YOU* can verify everything in this privacy policy (except what
happens once analytics information reaches Google) by viewing the source code
for the Web site or app:**

 * [The Web site's source code](http://code.s.zeid.me/amirunninglinux.com)
 * [The Android app's source code](http://code.s.zeid.me/amirunninglinux.apk)

**This is the most important part of the privacy policy.**

Personal information
--------------------

Am I Running Linux? does not intentionally collect any personal information.


Analytics
---------

The copy of amirunninglinux.com hosted at amirunninglinux.com and its
subdomains uses Google Analytics to collect non-personal information about
visitors, such as country, referring Web page, and technical information
about the device used to access the site.  The Android app is based on
the Web site and thus also uses Google Analytics.  For more privacy-related
information regarding Google Analytics, see:

* [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)
* [Safeguarding your data - Google Analytics Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245)
* [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

**Since Google does not publish the source code for Google Analytics,
*NOTHING* in the above documents can be verified.  If you wish to block
Google Analytics, it is recommended that you do not use their browser add-on
as it is also not free software.  Instead, use a free software content blocker
such as [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) to
block Google Analytics.**


Social platforms
----------------

Am I Running Linux? contains links to share the site/app via various social
networking or social news platforms.  See their privacy policies for details
on how they may use your information.  **Most of their privacy practices *CAN
NOT* be verified because they are not free software.  One exception is reddit,
whose source code is available at <https://github.com/reddit/> with [a few
exceptions](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/FAQ#is-this-all-of-the-code).**


App permissions
---------------

The Android app uses the following permission:

* **Full network access:** The app is a single-site browser for
  <http://amirunninglinux.com/>, and as such, it needs to access the Internet
  to be able to display the site. This permission is not used for anything
  else, and you can verify that by viewing the source code (see above).


Contact
-------

**If you believe that any part of Am I Running Linux? is behaving in a way
that is contrary to this privacy policy, please contact the developer at
`support AT s DOT zeid DOT me` or file a bug report on the relevant project.**
