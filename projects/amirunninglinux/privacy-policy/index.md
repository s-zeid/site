This is the privacy policy for Am I Running Linux?, which consists of
[a Web site][amirunninglinux.com] and [an Android app][amirunninglinux.apk].
As they are [free software][free-sw] and thus can be modified by anyone, this
policy ***only*** applies to the official distributions:

**Web site:**

* As hosted at `amirunninglinux.com` and its subdomains, or on the same server

**Android app:**

* As distributed through a source code repository or Web page owned by the user
  `scottywz` on GitLab, Bitbucket, GitHub, or hosted on the server that hosts
  `s.zeid.me`
* As distributed through [the official Google Play listing][google-play]

*Note:  "Server" in this context does not include other virtual machines on a
virtual machine host.*

[google-play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amirunninglinux


**This privacy policy is a supplement to [my main privacy
policy]({% root %}/legal/privacy-policy/), which contains some important
information not included here.  This privacy policy overrides that one in
case of any conflicts.**


Source code
-----------

**All parts of Am I Running Linux? are [free software][free-sw]; therefore,
*YOU* or someone you trust can verify everything this privacy policy says about
Am I Running Linux? by viewing the source code for the Web site or app:**

 * [The Web site's source code](https://code.s.zeid.me/amirunninglinux.com)
 * [The Android app's source code](https://code.s.zeid.me/amirunninglinux.apk)

***This is the most important part of the privacy policy.***

**Note that this privacy policy makes no guarantees about how your information
is used by other Web sites or entities.  Also, if you use a non-free Web browser
or operating system to visit or run Am I Running Linux? or to view, modify, or
share its source code, no guarantees can be made about what such non-free
software may do.**

***For maximum privacy, use only free software whenever possible.***

Information collected
---------------------

**Am I Running Linux? does not intentionally collect any personal information
from people of any age.**

Am I Running Linux? collects your browser's [user agent string][user-agent] in
order to try to determine whether you are running Linux.  Your user agent string
is not stored by me.  Note that if you have a unique enough user agent string,
[that could theoretically be used to identify you even though it doesn't
technically contain personal information](https://panopticlick.eff.org/).

Your browser will also send your IP address, which could be used to guess your
geographical location, but Am I Running Linux? ignores it.

Your user agent string and IP address could be stored by my hosting providers,
who are listed in [my main privacy policy]({% root %}/legal/privacy-policy/).

Social platforms
----------------

Am I Running Linux? contains links to share the site/app via various social
networking or social news platforms.  See their privacy policies for details
on how they may use your information.  **Most of their privacy practices *CAN
NOT* be verified because they are not free software.**


App permissions
---------------

The Android app uses the following permission:

* **Full network access:** The app is a single-site browser for
  <https://amirunninglinux.com/>, and as such, it needs to access the Internet
  to be able to display the site. This permission is not used for anything
  else, and you can verify that by viewing the source code (see above).


Contact
-------

**If you believe that any part of Am I Running Linux? is behaving in a way
that is contrary to this privacy policy, please contact the developer at
`support AT s DOT zeid DOT me` or file a bug report on the relevant project.**
