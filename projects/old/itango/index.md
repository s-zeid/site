## Download iTango {#download}

iTango is available on the Planet-iPhones repo via Cydia.  If you want to install
it manually, or if you want the source files:

* [Theme](http://uploads.srwz.us/iTango/iTango-3.1.zip)
* [Source files](http://uploads.srwz.us/iTango/iTango-3.1_Source.zip)
  - These require [The GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) and include a wealth of
    standalone icons and SVGs that form the basis of this theme.
    [See below for credits.](#credits)

## Requirements

* A jailbroken iPhone or iPod touch with iPhoneOS 2.x
* WinterBoard (available through Cydia)

## Installation

iTango is available on the Planet-iPhones repo via Cydia.  If you want to install
it manually (i.e. without using Cydia):

1.  [Download iTango](http://uploads.srwz.us/iTango/iTango-3.1.zip) and extract it.
2.  Copy the `iTango` folder to `/Library/Themes` on your device. &#x2a;
3.  Open WinterBoard.
4.  Select iTango, exit, and wait for it to respring.

&#x2a; If you're on a Unix-like platform (e.g. OS X, Linux) with SSH, rsync, and
Python 2.4 or later, you can just run `install.py <your phone's IP address>`
in lieu of step 2.  This will also restart the SpringBoard in case you're
upgrading iTango.

## Credits

Most of these icons come from a custom Gnome icon theme based on Foxtrot created with
[Tango Generator](http://mejogid.ohallwebservices.com/site/index.php?q=node/1),
but the real credit for a lot of them goes to the Tango Desktop Project.
PenguinPanic's icon comes from Crystal SVG, and TiVoRemote's icon comes from
hicolor's icon for gnome-lirc-properties.  I created the PocketTouch icon from
the iPod icon from the Foxtrot-based theme.  The icons for Twitter clients are
based on the [Pidgin](https://www.pidgin.im/) icon.

Most of the icon backgrounds were made by me.  The source files are based from
Jotlet's PSD file from their blog a long time ago, but I have replaced almost
everything in it, so only a few background layers are even based on theirs.
The glossy overlay, shadow, and layer mask all come from the PNGs that
MobileSafari uses to make Web clips, and credit for them goes to Apple.

The wallpaper comes from
