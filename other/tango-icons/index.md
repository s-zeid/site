Here are some Tango-style icons I've made.

## Boot {#boot}

This is very loosely based on
[the App\_bootman icon](https://uploads.s.zeid.me/tango-icons/Boot/App_bootman.svg)
from [the Haiku operating system](https://www.haiku-os.org/).

[48x48]({% include_relative icon.html name="Boot" url="48.svg" %})

This icon was made on July 29 and 30, 2014.

## Google+ {#google-plus}

{% include_relative icon.html name="Google-Plus" %}

**SVGs:**
[16x16]({% include_relative icon.html name="Google-Plus" url="16.svg" %})
[22x22]({% include_relative icon.html name="Google-Plus" url="22.svg" %})
[32x32]({% include_relative icon.html name="Google-Plus" url="32.svg" %})
[48x48]({% include_relative icon.html name="Google-Plus" url="48.svg" %})

## iTunes

This is a combination of
[emblem-music.svg](https://uploads.s.zeid.me/tango-icons/iTunes/emblem-music.svg) and
[media-optical.svg](https://uploads.s.zeid.me/tango-icons/iTunes/media-optical.svg),
both from the Tango project.

[16x16]({% include_relative icon.html name="iTunes" url="16.svg" %})
[48x48]({% include_relative icon.html name="iTunes" url="48.svg" %})

## TI-84 Plus Silver Edition {#ti-84-plus-silver-edition}

I made this icon from scratch, originally for personal use as a replacement
icon for [TilEm](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilem/) and
[TiLP](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/).  It has since been incorporated into
the TilEm project as the application's official icon,
[with a different image on the calculator's screen](//uploads.srwz.us/tango-icons/TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition/TilEm-48.png).

{% include_relative icon.html name="TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition" %}

**SVGs:**
[16x16]({% include_relative icon.html name="TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition" url="16.svg" %})
[24x24]({% include_relative icon.html name="TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition" url="24.svg" %})
[32x32]({% include_relative icon.html name="TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition" url="32.svg" %})
[48x48]({% include_relative icon.html name="TI-84-Plus-Silver-Edition" url="48.svg" %})

## TiVo<sup>®</sup> {#tivo}

I made this from an SVG of the real TiVo logo.

{% include_relative icon.html name="TiVo" %}

**SVGs:**
[16x16]({% include_relative icon.html name="TiVo" url="16.svg" %})
[22x22]({% include_relative icon.html name="TiVo" url="22.svg" %})

## License

License information for each icon can be found underneath each individual icon.

Some icons are not released under any particular license, and do not have
explicit license information underneath them, particularly those which are
drawings of trademarked logos, but I really do not care what you do with
those icons. However, I would appreciate it if you give the original trademark
holders (if any) credit and then give me credit.

Unless otherwise noted, the other icons are dual-licensed under the X11 License,
a simple permissive license compatible with the GNU GPL, and
[the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/),
which is not compatible with the GPL. These icons are dual-licensed like this
specifically to ensure compatibility with the GPL, and to encourage use in works
of all licenses, including
[Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
and Creative Commons works. For these dual-licensed icons, you may choose which
license you use the icons under as long as you follow the terms of the license
you choose. Both licenses require that you give me credit. At minimum, you need
to reproduce the copyright notice ("Copyright (C) (year) S. Zeid.") and
reproduce the license text (for the X11 License) or linking to the license
(Creative Commons). Both licenses prohibit you from using my name in advertising
or promotions, or to suggest an endorsement.

Some icons are only licensed under one license.
