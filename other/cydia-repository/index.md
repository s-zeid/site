I have my own Cydia repository at [http://apt.srwz.us/ios/](http://apt.srwz.us/ios/).

To add it to Cydia:

1.  Open Cydia.
2.  Go to **Manage** &gt; **Sources**.
3.  Tap **Edit**, then **Add**.
4.  Type in _[apt.srwz.us/ios/](http://apt.srwz.us/ios/)_ (be sure to include the /).
5.  Tap **Add Source**, and wait.
